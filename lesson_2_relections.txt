1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A directory .git is created when I initialize a repository. I need this directory to keep commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the intermedia place for file commits to be created. It can save files you want to commit and then save them as a single commit at the same time.
